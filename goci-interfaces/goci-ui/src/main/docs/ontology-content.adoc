== Ontologies in the GWAS Catalog

All curated traits descriptions are mapped to terms from the http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/[Experimental Factor Ontology] (EFO).
Traits in the GWAS Catalog are highly diverse and include diseases, e.g. Type II diabetes, disease markers, e.g. measurements of blood glucose concentration, and non-clinical phenotypes, e.g. hair color.
EFO was chosen as the ontology to represent GWAS Catalog traits as it is highly adaptable and extensible, combining parts of several biological domain-specific ontologies and allowing modelling of tests, diseases, anatomy and anthropometry.
Accurate mapping of curated trait descriptions to EFO terms facilitates searching, visualisation and integration of GWAS Catalog data with other resources.

EFO is freely available in OWL format from http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo[the EFO website] and can be browsed in http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/beta/ontologies/efo[the Ontology Lookup Service].
Mappings of all GWAS Catalog trait descriptions to EFO terms will soon be available through our downloads page, along with the GWAS Catalog ontology schema and data knowledgebase.
