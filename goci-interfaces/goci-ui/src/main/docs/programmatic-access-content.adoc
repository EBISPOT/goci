= Programmatic access

== Programmatic access

The full REST API for the GWAS Catalog is now available for testing at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/labs/rest/. We welcome any and all suggestions, comments and bug reports - please get in touch at gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk.

You can still link into the Catalog and build bookmarks using the guide below but if you used this approach to programmatically retrieve data from the Catalog, we would suggest updating your code to use the REST API.



=== Bookmarking your searches

You can bookmark all queries for main search terms, eg http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/search?query=diabetes[diabetes] as well as for individual search facets, eg http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/search?query=diabetes#association[only associations (not studies or traits) for the term diabetes]. It is currently not possible to bookmark filters, so if you are only interested in associations with a certain p-value cut-off or studies published after a certain date, you will still need to reapply these filters every time you return to the search.


=== Bookmarking help documents

You can bookmark any part of the GWAS Catalog page, including individual questions in the link:faq[FAQ]. Please note that if you use Chrome as your web browser, jumping directly to a question may not always work. This is a browser bug outside our control.


=== Linking into the Catalog

Any concept that can be searched in the Catalog can also be linked to via a structured URL.
Links should be structured using the GWAS catalog domain (normally `www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas`), and individual resources can be linked to using the paths as defined below.

==== Traits

Link to a trait using a catalog trait name:

 GET search?query=breast%20cancer

Link to a trait using an ontology ID:

 GET search?query=EFO_0004541

==== SNPs

Link to a SNP using an rsID:

 GET search?query=rs7329174

==== Genes

Link to a Gene by HGNC gene name:

 GET search?query=HBS1L

==== Studies

Link to a publication by Pubmed ID:

 GET search?query=23043469
