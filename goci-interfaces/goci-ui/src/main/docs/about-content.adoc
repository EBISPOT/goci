== About the GWAS Catalog

The GWAS Catalog is provided jointly by the http://www.genome.gov[National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)] and the http://www.ebi.ac.uk[European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)]. The Catalog was founded by the NHGRI in 2008, with delivery and development of the Catalog being a collaborative project between the EMBL-EBI and NHGRI from September 2010 to the present. In March 2015 the Catalog infrastructure moved to EMBL-EBI to enable delivery of an improved user interface and curatorial infrastructure, funded by http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8739756&icde=23818978[NHGRI Grant Number 1U41HG007823-01].

The Catalog is a quality controlled, manually curated, literature-derived collection of all published http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study[genome-wide association studies] assaying at least 100,000 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism[SNPs] and all SNP-trait associations with p-values < 1.0 x 10^-5^ _(Hindorff et al., 2009)_.

The Catalog also publishes the iconic GWAS diagram of all SNP-trait associations, with p-values &le; 5.0 x 10^-8^, mapped onto the human genome by chromosomal locations and displayed on the human karyotype.
The diagram is released quarterly and the latest version of the diagram is made available on our website in PDF format and as a PowerPoint slide.
