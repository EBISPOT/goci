== About the GWAS Catalog

The Catalog was founded by the https://www.genome.gov[NHGRI] in 2008, in response to the rapid increase in the number of published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These studies provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of common variants on complex disease; however identifying published GWAS can be challenging, and the vast wealth of data contained within these publications is effectively inaccessible to researchers without systematic cataloguing and summarization of the observed associations. The GWAS Catalog provides a consistent, searchable, visualisable and freely available database of published SNP-trait associations, which can be easily integrated with other resources, and is accessed by scientists, clinicians and other users worldwide.
Within the Catalog, all link:methods[eligible] GWA studies are identified by literature search and assessed by our curators, who then extract the reported trait, significant SNP-trait associations, and sample metadata. We aim to curate eligible studies within 1-2 months of publication, dependent on the availability of literature, and the data is released on a weekly cycle. The Catalog also publishes the iconic https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/diagram[GWAS diagram] of SNP-trait associations, mapped onto the human genome by chromosomal location and displayed on the human karyotype.
Since 2010, delivery and development of the Catalog has been a collaborative project between the EMBL-EBI and NHGRI. The Catalog website and infrastructure is now hosted by EMBL-EBI. A team of curators, all of whom are experienced molecular biologists, curate the data, and provide user support. The curation team is supported by dedicated software developers, and is lead by Fiona Cunningham, Paul Flicek & Helen Parkinson, and Lucia Hindorff at the NHGRI. We work closely with the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/helen-parkinson[SPOT] and http://www.ensembl.org/info/about/index.html[Ensembl] teams at the EBI, and receive input from an independent Scientific Advisory Board.
