As part of ongoing improvements mapping information will be added for all GWAS Catalog SNPs to Ensembl genes, in addition to NCBI genes. Multiple genomic locations for SNPs that map to multiple locations within the primary assembly will also be included.

We are in the process of testing and developing this feature and in order to gather feedback the GWAS Catalog with added mapping information is link:../api/search/downloads/ensembl_mapping[available for download here].

A description of the headers in this file can be found link:mappingfileheaders[here]. The information in this file is generated using the link:http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/index.html[Ensembl API] and the source of the data is both Ensembl and NCBI. The data was produced using a snapshot of our database as of the 9th of September 2015 and includes studies with a date added to catalog up to July 2015.

We'd love to hear what you think of this new feature, contact the GWAS Catalog team on mailto:gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk[gwas-info@ebi.ac.uk]
