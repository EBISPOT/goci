[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

This API supports the following HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

This API tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist
|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

//Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
//that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:
//
//include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]
//
//For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent tag to a resource will produce a
//`400 Bad Request` response:
//
//include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]


[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

This API uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found benath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not created URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
from resource to resource.

[[overview-pagination]]
== Listing resources

Requests that return multiple resources will be paginated to 20 items by default. You can change number of items
returned using the `size` parameter up to a maximum of 500 for a single request. The API also supports the `page`
parameter for accessing a specific page of items.

=== Paging resources

Links will be provided in the response to navigate the resources.
