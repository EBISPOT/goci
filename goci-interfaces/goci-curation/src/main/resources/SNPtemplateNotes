Gene	-	must not be empty!
Strongest SNP-Risk Allele	-	must not be empty!
SNP	-	must not be empty!
Risk Allele -	must not be empty!
Frequency in Controls	-	must not be empty! enter NR is not reported
P-value mantissa	- enter p-value mantissa only
P-value exponent	- enter p-value exponent only
P-value (Text)		- same as in web form
OR per copy or beta (Num)	- must be either numeric or empty. If reciprocal is given, program will calculate OR from that.
OR entered (reciprocal)	- must be numeric or empty
OR-type? (Y/N)	 -	must not be empty!
Confidence Interval - if no CI given but there is a std error, leave blank and programm will calculate CI.
Beta unit and direction	 -	must not be empty!
Standard Error	- must be numeric or empty
SNP type (novel/known) -	must not be empty!

NOTE!
- "must not be empty" refers to a literally empty cell. "NR" (or similar) is a perfectly valid entry

- Reciprocal confidence intervals: If OR < 1 and a CI is given, the program will automatically calculate the reciprocal CI, provided that *both ends of the CI are greater than 0*! 
	Program can't handle negative CIs, enter that SNP manually.
