Gene(s) - must not be empty!
       Enter NR when not recorded
       For multi-snp haplotypes use a single comma separated list
       For SNP interactions separate per interaction using an ‘x’ but if more than one gene is assigned to an interaction use a comma
       e.g. NR x FRS2, SFRP1

Strongest SNP-Risk Allele - must not be empty!

SNP	- must not be empty!

Proxy SNP -	must not be empty!
            Enter NR when not recorded
            For multi-snp haplotypes use a single comma separated list
            For SNP interactions separate per interaction using an ‘x’

Independent SNP risk allele frequency in controls - only applies to SNP interaction associations,
                                                    leave blank for multi-SNP and standard associations.
                                                    Value must be present for each risk allele in the interaction,
                                                    NR can be used if not reported e.g. NR x 1.5

Risk element (allele, haplotype or SNPxSNP interaction) frequency in controls - must not be empty! enter NR if not reported

P-value mantissa - enter p-value mantissa only

P-value exponent - enter p-value exponent only

P-value description - same as in web form

Effect type -  options are "OR", "Beta" and "NR"

OR - must be either numeric or empty. If reciprocal is given, program will calculate OR from that.

OR reciprocal - must be numeric or empty

Beta - must be either numeric or empty

Beta unit

Beta direction

Range - if no range given but there is a standard error, leave blank and program will calculate range.

OR reciprocal range

Standard Error	- must be numeric or empty

OR/Beta description

Multi-SNP Haplotype? (Y/N) -	must not be empty!

SNP:SNP interaction? (Y/N) -	must not be empty!

SNP Status - only applies to SNP interaction associations, leave blank for multi-SNP and standard associations.
             Value must be present for each risk allele in the interaction,
             LL = limited list, GW = genome wide,  NR can be used if not reported.
             e.g. NR x GL,LL x LL

SNP type (novel/known) - must not be empty!

EFO traits - EFO trait ID e.g. EFO_0004328

NOTE:

- "must not be empty" refers to a literally empty cell. "NR" is a perfectly valid entry

- OR reciprocal range: If OR < 1 and a range is given, the program will automatically OR reciprocal range, provided that *both ends of the range
are greater than 0*! Program can't handle negative ranges, enter that SNP manually.

- Separate SNP interactions using 'x' e.g. rs4784379-A x rs9804128-G

- Separate haplotypes using ',' e.g. rs7839488, rs4395927, rs9331888
