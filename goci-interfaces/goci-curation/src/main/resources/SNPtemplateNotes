Gene - must not be empty!
Strongest SNP-Risk Allele - must not be empty!
SNP	- must not be empty!
Proxy SNP -	must not be empty!
Risk Allele Frequency in Controls - must not be empty! enter NR if not reported for each allele
Association Risk Frequency - must not be empty! enter NR if not reported
P-value mantissa - enter p-value mantissa only
P-value exponent - enter p-value exponent only
P-value (Text) - same as in web form
OR per copy or beta (Num) - must be either numeric or empty. If reciprocal is given, program will calculate OR from that.
OR entered (reciprocal)	- must be numeric or empty
OR-type? (Y/N) -	must not be empty!
Multi-SNP Haplotype? (Y/N) -	must not be empty!
SNP:SNP interaction? (Y/N) -	must not be empty!
Confidence Interval - if no CI given but there is a std error, leave blank and program will calculate CI.
Reciprocal confidence interval
Beta unit and direction	 -	must not be empty!
Standard Error	- must be numeric or empty
SNP type (novel/known) - must not be empty!
EFO traits - EFO trait ID e.g. EFO_0004328

NOTE:

- "must not be empty" refers to a literally empty cell. "NR" is a perfectly valid entry

- Reciprocal confidence intervals: If OR < 1 and a CI is given, the program will automatically calculate the reciprocal
 CI, provided that *both ends of the CI are greater than 0*! Program can't handle negative CIs, enter that SNP manually.

- Separate SNP interactions using 'x' e.g. rs4784379-A x rs9804128-G

- Separate haplotypes using ',' e.g. rs7839488, rs4395927, rs9331888
